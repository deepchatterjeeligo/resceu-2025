# RESCEU summer school 2025

This is a set of three lectures on application of machine-learning (ML)
using neural-networks in gravitational-wave physics. The first lecture
is a research talk specific to gravitational waves. The content of second
and third are general, and can be applied to other domains.

## [Lecture 1](/lecture_1/README.md)

- Research talk on application of ML to gravitational-wave astronomy.

## [Lecture 2](/lecture_2)

- Basics of neural networks: function approximation property
- Construction and training using pytorch framework: loss functions, backpropagation,
  training loop, learning rate schedule.
- Distribution approximation: learning an apprximator from samples.

## [Lecture 3](/lecture_3)

- A brief intro to the pytorch-lightning framework.
- An exercise in likelihood-free inference: training a normalizing flow
  for posterior estimation of parameters of a line.
